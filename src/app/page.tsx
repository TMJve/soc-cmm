        The SOC-CMM model is a capability maturity model that can be used to perform a self-assessment of your Security Operations Center (SOC). The model is based on review conducted on literature regarding SOC setup and existing SOC models as well as literature on specific elements within a SOC. The literature analysis was then validated by questioning several Security Operations Centers in different sectors and on different maturity levels to determine which elements were actually in place. The output from the survey, combined with the initial analysis is the basis for this self-assessment.
